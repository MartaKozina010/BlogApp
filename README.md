This app uses NewsAPI and because it's used for main functionalities like displaying a list of articles, searching them and reading, it doesn't make sense to publish it as gh-page. Since 22 May 2020 they changed the liberties of the free developer keys and now they reject any request using that key that is not coming from localhost (got 426 error). Running locally everything works fine.
